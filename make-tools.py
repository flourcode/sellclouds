        ('how', 'Five questions, in this order', '''    <p class="lede">The first question a new manager asks is usually "what's wrong with these reps?" The better one
      is "what exactly did I inherit?" The order below is the order to think in.</p>
    <p><strong>PATCH: Could a good rep make this number here?</strong> Territory, account quality, installed base,
      the quota, the comp plan, the competitive situation, who has had the patch before. If three people have
      failed in the same patch, you probably do not have three bad reps. Look here first, and be honest, because
      nothing you do to the rep matters if the answer is no.</p>
    <p><strong>CUSTOMERS: Do customers choose them?</strong> Not meeting count. Five real customer conversations beat
      fifteen calendar entries. Do customers call back, take the next step, introduce them upward? The weird rep
      who skips internal meetings but has customers calling her may be worth more than the polished one with
      immaculate CRM hygiene and no pull.</p>
    <p><strong>PIPELINE: What exists because they're here?</strong> Separate inherited and renewal business from what
      they created. Ask where the pipeline came from, how old it is, whether it is moving, and what customer
      evidence makes it real. A seller can look fine today and leave a crater for next year.</p>
    <p><strong>CRAFT: Can they actually sell?</strong> Prospect, run discovery, understand the customer's business,
      qualify, get to power, build urgency, get through procurement, close. This is the question that separates
      <em>can't do it</em> from <em>isn't doing it</em>, and those are completely different management problems. One
      you coach. The other you manage.</p>
    <p><strong>WILL: Are they still trying to win?</strong> Energy, ownership, follow-through, coachability. A rep who
      has decided the year is over stops doing the things that would have saved it. The activity goes first, then
      the pipeline, then the rep.</p>'''),
        ('buckets', 'Four kinds of problem, and the one that isn\'t', '''    <p><strong>Good rep, bad situation.</strong> Fix the situation: the patch, the number, or the plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Good rep, skill gap.</strong> Coach them. Name the skill and work it, one deal at a time.</p>
    <p><strong>Capable rep, effort gap.</strong> Manage them. Expectations in writing, with dates.</p>
    <p><strong>Wrong rep, reasonable situation.</strong> Start the process. Waiting does not make it kinder.</p>
    <p><strong>They're fine.</strong> Leave them alone. Do not invent a management problem because they do not love
      one-on-ones. Figure out what visibility you actually need and let them sell.</p>
    <p>The mistake this tool exists to prevent is spending six months coaching a territory problem, or redesigning a
      territory to avoid dealing with a performance problem. The manager's first job is not to make everybody look
      alike. It is to figure out which differences matter to selling and which do not.</p>
    <p>Do not decide who is good and who is bad in your first few weeks. Sit with each rep and go through five real
      opportunities. Listen to how they describe the customer. You will learn more in that ninety minutes than in
      a month of dashboards, and every one of those five deals can go through <a href="/deal/">Deal Check</a> while

      seconds to managers who don't know them, and having the explanation survive their questions.</p>
    <p>Every calibration room runs the same way: you propose, they probe, the evaluation moves if you can't hold it.
      The managers across the table are not hostile. They just haven't seen your rep's year, so all they can test is
      your case. A case is receipts, ownership, scope, behavior and next scope. Everything else is adjectives.</p>
    <p><strong>RECEIPTS: Three things, each with a number.</strong> Amazon's own self-review now asks for three to five
      accomplishments with measurable outcomes. If you can't name three with a number on them, the room hears "had a
      good year," and "had a good year" loses to anyone who brought a spreadsheet.</p>
    <p><strong>OWNERSHIP: What wouldn't have happened without them?</strong> The first question in any room is how much of
      the outcome belongs to this person versus the team, the partner, or the market. If you can answer that in one
      sentence for the biggest win, the rest of the case is easier.</p>
    <p><strong>SCOPE: Their level, not the level below.</strong> "Strong L5 execution" is the polite way a room says no to
      an L6 case. What made the problem their-level sized: the ambiguity, the number of teams, the absence of a
      playbook, the decisions nobody else was going to make?</p>
    <p><strong>HOW: One example per principle.</strong> Leadership principles are behavioral standards, not compliments.
      The room will ask for the example. If you'll cite four principles, bring four examples, and drop the ones you
      can't back.</p>
    <p><strong>NEXT: The harder thing.</strong> Potential is not "I think she's a future VP." It is the problem you would
      hand them next year that you wouldn't have handed them last year, and what they've already done that makes you
      sure. Scope, complexity, or impact, growing.</p>'''),

    <p><strong>POINT: One sentence, and why now.</strong> If you cannot say what you want the room to decide in one
      sentence, the brief does not have a point yet, it has a topic. And "why now" is the second half of the
      sentence, because a room that agrees with you and does nothing has not agreed with you.</p>

      at least one piece that did not come from your own team, because the room discounts everything that did.</p>

      fall apart. Why this instead of doing nothing? Why build instead of buy? Why us instead of them? If the brief
      does not answer the alternative someone in the room already prefers, that person will answer it for you.</p>
    <p><strong>HOLE: Your own weakest assumption, and who will find it.</strong> The most important question in the
      tool. If you know where the soft spot is, you can lead with it, and a room respects a brief that names its own
      risk. If you don't, somebody whose incentives differ from yours will find it, and they will not be gentle.</p>
    <p><strong>ASK: What you need today, and who owns what next.</strong> A shocking number of decks survive thirty

    <p>It came from a win rate. If a third of the qualified pipeline due in a period closes, 3X covers the number
      exactly. So 3X is a 33% win rate written down without saying so.</p>
    <p>Here's why that matters. A team that wins 20% of what it qualifies needs 5X. A team that wins half needs
      2X. If your team wins 20% and plans to 3X, the forecast is wrong on day one, and nobody finds out until the
      quarter is mostly gone.</p>
    <p>The other word doing a lot of work is <em>qualified</em>. Coverage only counts pipeline that would survive a
      hard question about the customer, the money, the person you're talking to, the path to a purchase order and
      the reason it happens now. Everything else in the CRM is a conversation.</p>
    <h3>Here's a simple way to tell</h3>
    <p>Take your qualified win rate for the last four quarters. Divide one by it. That's your coverage number, not
      three. Then count only the pipeline you'd defend in a review, and hold it up against that.</p>''',

      The trouble is the moment before that.</p>
    <p>Over the years, most questionable deals I've seen broke in one of five places. Nobody at the customer had
      said out loud that they wanted it. The money didn't have a name. We hadn't met anyone who could make it
      happen. Nobody knew how they'd actually buy it. And nothing was forcing it this year.</p>
    <p>BANT gets you close, but its need is usually something the seller diagnosed, and its timeline is a date in
      the CRM rather than a reason anything happens. It also skips the biggest federal question: how does a
      purchase order actually appear? Contract vehicle, contracting office, acquisition lead time. That's the
      timeline.</p>
    <p>MEDDIC, or MEDDPICC depending on who taught it to you, is more sophisticated, and that's exactly why it
      solves a different problem. A seller can spend forty-five minutes deciding whether somebody counts as an
      economic buyer. Five plain questions are a cross-examination, not a worksheet. They run before that debate is
      worth having.</p>

    <p>The first question most new managers ask is what's wrong with these reps. The better one is what exactly did
      I inherit. The order you ask in is the order you think in, and it decides what you do for the next six
      months.</p>
    <p>Start with the patch. Territory, account quality, installed base, the quota, the comp plan, who had it
      before. If a good rep couldn't make the number there, nothing you do to the person matters. Fix the patch,
      fix the number, or fix the plan.</p>
    <p>Then the person, in this order. Do customers choose to spend time with them? Is there pipeline that exists
      only because they're here? When they're in front of a customer, can they actually sell? Are they still
      trying to win? The third question is the one most managers skip, and it's the one that separates can't from
      isn't. One you coach. The other you manage.</p>
    <p>Watch out for the rep you'd write off first. The one who skips internal meetings but has customers calling
      back may be worth more than the polished one with perfect CRM hygiene and no pull.</p>

      more in ninety minutes than in a month of dashboards.</p>''',
