# KillMyDeal.com — handoff

Everything needed to maintain, extend or rebuild this. One directory, two
pages, one shared stylesheet and font, no build step, no server, no dependencies.

**Current build: 2026-10-02.1100**

## Naming: checks, not kills

The tools were called *Kill My Deal*, *Kill My Pipeline* and so on until
October 2026. The sales-humor didn't land with a lot of readers, and "kill"
unsettled some, so the family became **checks**: Deal Check, Pipeline Check,
Brief Check, Territory Check, Partner Check, Rep Check, OLR Check, under the
umbrella line *Quick reality checks for complicated deals*. Buttons read
*Check my deal*, *Check a deal*, *Check my case* (OLR). The punch lives in
the headlines instead of the names: *Before you commit it, prove it.*,
*Before you renew the partnership, test it.*, *Before you walk into OLR,
test your case.* Verdicts lost the same edge: Deal Check is **Healthy /
Hopium / At risk / Not a deal yet**, Pipeline Check is **Covered / Hopium /
At risk / Short**, and the 404 says *Wrong turn.* *Hopium* stays: it's the
most-quoted word on the site and funny without being dark. Do not bring
"kill", "dead" or weapons language back into names, headlines, verdicts or
buttons. The dead bluebird mascot is retired; the only mark is Mark's
S-cloud. The engine is `check.js` (`CheckTool({...})`); URLs and analytics
event names were already neutral and did not change.

## SellClouds

As of October 2026 the site is **SellClouds** (sellclouds.com): Mark's shelf
of free tools and field notes for people selling cloud, AI, cyber and data to
government. Deal Check is the first tool on the shelf, not the brand. The
positioning is Rick Steves, not a consultancy: *I've been there, here's how
the train works.* Language to use: "here's how I think about it", "watch out
for this", "here's a simple way to tell", "use whatever helps". Language to
never use: best practices, sales excellence, GTM transformation, revenue
acceleration, framework, thought leadership, masterclass.

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | **SellClouds home**: hero, *What are you working on?* doorways (one per tool), how the tools work, Field Notes, About, FAQ |
| `/deal/` | **Deal Check**, formerly the home page |
| `/pipeline/` | **Pipeline Check**, the calculator |
| `/brief/`, `/territory/`, `/partner/`, `/rep/`, `/olr/` | the generated five-question tools |
| `/notes/` | **Field Notes**: short reads, each ending with the tool that does the math |
| `partials/mark.html` | the About section every page carries (bio, situations, *Need another set of eyes?*) |
| `home.src.html` | source for the home page; the script fills in the notes list |
| `site.css`, `inter.woff2` | shared design system and typeface |
| `check.js`, `make-tools.py` | the shared engine; the generator for tools, notes, home, header and About |

**One command builds everything.** `python3 make-tools.py` regenerates the five
question tools, the Field Notes, the home page, then stamps the same header
and the same About section onto every page (including the hand-written Deal
and Pipeline pages and the 404), then rebuilds every FAQ's structured data.
Edit the header in `header()`, the About in `partials/mark.html`, a note in
`NOTES`; never edit those parts inside a page.

**Nav.** Header: bird + *SellClouds* (home), *Field Notes* and *About* as
text links on screens 700px and wider, an *Ask Mark* chip that jumps to the
*Need another set of eyes?* heading on the current page, and the *Tools*
menu, which also carries Field Notes and About for phones. No Services, no
Solutions, no Consulting.

**The ask is soft on purpose.** The three-tier rate card is gone. The About
section ends *Need another set of eyes? 20 minutes. Free. No deck required.*
and one quiet line: *If it's something that takes more than a conversation,
we can figure that out too.* That is the whole consulting pitch.

**Not built yet, deliberately.** *Field Kits* (paid PDF guidebooks) go into
the nav when the first one exists and not before; a store with prices for
things that don't exist is the one un-Rick-Steves move available. The line
*"They're free. I'm retired. I have time."* was proposed for the home page
and left out; it's Mark's to say, and it sits oddly next to a booking link.


**The mark** is Mark's own design: an S drawn as one flowing stroke through a
six-lobed cloud. `logo.svg` is built from geometry, not traced: six identical
circles (centerline radius 128.5) on a regular hexagon around the origin,
joined at six notches, plus one symmetric cubic curve for the S, all at a
single stroke width of 59.1 on a 654 × 704 canvas. It's under 500 bytes and
smooth at any size. `logo-dark.svg` is the same in `#E8EDF2`; `favicon.svg`
switches with the browser's colour scheme; `favicon.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`
and `logo.png` (600px tall, for the share card) are rendered from the SVG. If
the mark is ever edited, edit the SVG and re-render the PNGs from it. The dead
bird stays as the Deal Check mascot on the tool share cards and the 404.

**Footers** all end *Not affiliated with the U.S. government or Amazon.*
The OLR tool and the AWS credentials make the Amazon half worth saying.

The third part of the family — can the team defend what they're carrying — is
the consulting, not software. Do not brand it "Kill My Review"; two products
and a person is a system, three "Kill My" things is a bit.

## 1. What it is

A federal seller answers five questions about a deal and gets a verdict, the
question their manager is most likely to ask, and the one thing to go do before
the review. About a minute on a phone.

It is not a CRM, a forecast model, or a system of record. It is a **rehearsal**:
the sixty seconds before somebody senior says *"okay, tell me about this deal."*

**Hero:** *Before you commit it, try to kill it.*
**Promise:** *Five questions to separate proof from hopium before your manager does.*
**Philosophy (not on the page):** *Hope is not evidence.*

### The vocabulary

One system, four words. Everything on the site should fit inside it:

| Word | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Kill** | the action — try to disprove your own forecast first |
| **Hopium** | the problem — what you believe but haven't proved |
| **Proof** | the cure — the artifact or the person that settles it |
| **Commit** | the moment that matters — the decision the seller and manager make, not the tool |

**The intellectual claim, and its limit.** The site does not claim a new
methodology. It claims a narrower job: *MEDDIC helps you work the deal; Kill My
Deal helps you decide whether you've earned the right to call it one.* The "Why
these five" section makes that argument — each question disproves a different
failure mode (inventing the requirement, no real money, access without
influence, no way to transact, no reason to act) and PATH is the one BANT and
MEDDIC underweight, which is the federal-specific reason this exists. Keep that
framing: a gate before those frameworks matter, never a replacement for them.

Three phrases carry it: **TRY TO KILL IT** (product), **HOPE IS NOT EVIDENCE**
(philosophy), **BRING THE PROOF** (standard). The middle one belongs in talks,
posts and the way the offer is described — it was tried as a line under the five
questions on the homepage and read as preaching. The site should demonstrate the
idea, not announce it. The four verdicts are written in
that language — *it survived, bring the proof / you believe it, you haven't
proved it / something important is still an assumption / this is a conversation,
not a deal* — as is the managers section ("get the hopium out of the pipeline
before the review") and the free call ("bring me a deal and we'll try to kill it
together").

Hopium is the recurring joke **inside** the system, never the brand itself.
Do not make "get off the hopium" the tagline: it tips into sales-guru bit, which
the voice rules below rule out. It works as occasional copy and would work as a
content series.

The dead bluebird is the **mascot, not the message**. The user never has to
understand the metaphor: the bird carries the brand in the logo and the share
card while the words carry the instruction. Copy explaining what a bluebird is
was removed from the hero and the lede. It lives in exactly one place: the FAQ
entry "What is a bluebird in sales?", which is a real search and the only spot
a curious reader can learn what the logo is.

A bluebird, in sales, is the deal nobody worked for — an inbound call, a warm
introduction, a requirement that appears out of nowhere. They feel like luck,
which is why they get forecast on feelings instead of facts. The whole brand
sits on that joke: the logo is a dead bluebird, and the tool tells you which
kind you are holding.

---

## 2. Who uses it

**The seller.** Ten minutes before a pipeline review, on a phone, often carrying
a deal they already suspect is soft. Ages run Gen X to Gen Z, so the design can
skew neither corporate-beige nor startup-toy — it has to be something nobody is
embarrassed to be caught using at work.

**The manager.** Asks the five questions out loud during a review and taps the
answers as the rep gives them. Gets a neutral instrument, so the disagreement is
with the rubric rather than with them.

**The skeptic.** A federal seller who has been pitched a lot of sales software
and assumes anything free is harvesting something. This person is why the
privacy design is absolute and why the scoring math is printed on the page.

---

## 3. The end goal

1. **Be genuinely useful in one minute.** Nothing else works if that fails. The
   measure is whether a seller walks into a review already knowing where they
   will get hit.
2. **Earn a conversation with Mark.** The result writes the DM for them — a
   sanitized one-liner naming their weakest pillar — and one tap copies it and
   opens LinkedIn. Calendly is the secondary path for people who already know
   they need help.

Not goals: accounts, retention, a SaaS product, traffic for its own sake. If a
change requires a database or a login, it is the wrong change.

**Sharing is not the growth mechanic.** A bad verdict is self-incriminating and
a good one is boring, so almost nobody pastes it in a team channel. The share
block exists, but the DM is the conversion path; do not re-prioritise them.

---

## 4. How the scoring works

Five pillars, chosen to be memorable without opening the site:
**CUSTOMER · MONEY · POWER · PATH · NOW.**

Each is answered YES / SORT OF / NO, worth **92 / 50 / 8**, weighted:

| Pillar | Weight | Question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MONEY | 26 | Do you know where the money comes from? |
| POWER | 22 | Are you talking to someone who can make this happen? |
| CUSTOMER | 20 | Has the customer actually said they want to solve this? |
| PATH | 16 | Do you know how they will buy it? |
| NOW | 16 | Is there a real reason this happens now? |

Three caps, each printing its reason on screen:

| Condition | Cap | Reason shown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MONEY = NO | 55 | you can't say where the money comes from |
| POWER = NO | 60 | you haven't reached anyone who can act |
| CUSTOMER = NO | 45 | the customer hasn't confirmed they intend to act |
| **any pillar = NO** | **74** | **you answered no on {pillar}** |

That last row is an invariant, not a tuning choice: **no deal with a flat NO can
be HEALTHY.** Before it existed, YES on everything but PATH scored 79 and printed
HEALTHY with "nothing obvious to attack" while the same screen showed PATH = NO.
The prose elsewhere says a missing acquisition path makes the timeline guesswork
and that the weakest link sets the forecast; the score has to agree.

Verdicts:

| Score | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| 75+ | **HEALTHY** |
| 55–74 | **HOPIUM** |
| 35–54 | **ON LIFE SUPPORT** |
| under 35 | **DEAD ON ARRIVAL** |

The ladder is medical and the mascot is a bird; they meet at "dead," which is
the only place they need to agree. An earlier draft used GRILL IT for the second
tier, which collided with the GRILL ME button two inches below it. Do not
reintroduce that.

Everything else is a lookup keyed to the **weakest pillar**, ties broken toward
MONEY because money is what gets attacked: the attack line (`ATTACK`, with
`POWER_ATTACKS` randomising the power variant), the BE READY FOR question, the
three Boss Mode questions (`GRILL`), and the ordered actions (`FIX`) — every
pillar not answered YES, weakest first, capped at three.

**Honest limits, stated in the FAQ and worth keeping:** the weights are not
calibrated against thousands of closed deals and the tool has never seen the
pipeline. What it offers is consistency. *Use it to find the hole, not to set
the number.*

**The tool never makes the commit decision.** HEALTHY reads "no obvious fatal
hole — bring the proof and defend the deal," not "commit it." The other three
tiers may warn against committing, which is a different thing from authorising
it. The promise is: the tool pressure-tests, the seller and the manager decide
the forecast. Copy that crosses that line undermines the rigor FAQ two sections
below it.

---

## 5. There is no AI, on purpose

An earlier build sent the five answers to a language model for coaching. It
produced confident, specific, wrong advice — task orders, recompetes and bridge
contracts nobody had mentioned — because five words is not enough context to
reason from. Confident wrong advice is worse than none when the whole promise is
that every line is defensible.

That is the bar for anyone revisiting it: the model must not be able to invent
procurement context. The deterministic list cannot.

---

## 6. Privacy is a feature, not a footnote

Nothing the user enters is stored or transmitted. No localStorage, no cookies,
no analytics on answers, no server, no account. The tool never asks for the
customer, agency, contract number, partner or dollar value.

**If you add analytics, a save feature, a CRM integration or an AI call, the
copy on the page stops being true.** Update it in the same commit or don't make
the change. The claim lives in two places per page and no more: one clause in
the dek (*No deal data* / *Nothing stored*) and the FAQ entry "Does anything I
enter leave my device?". It used to be in five, and repeating a privacy promise
reads as protesting too much.

**Analytics, and what the promise now says.** `analytics.js` loads Google
Analytics 4 when `GA_ID` is set. That changed the FAQ wording from "no
analytics" to "counts page views and never sends your answers", which is
exactly true and must stay true. Two guarantees are built in: `page_location`
is sent without the URL fragment, so a shared verdict (`#ysnys`) or the
pipeline numbers never reach Google; and the events the pages fire (`start`,
`verdict`, `verdict_shared`, `grill`, `share`, `dm_copy`, `pipeline_edit`,
`pipeline_share`, `pipeline_dm_copy`) carry no parameters. Never add an event
parameter that contains an answer, a score, a number or DM text. Events
fired before the deferred script loads are queued and flushed.

---

## 7. The ask, and how it spreads

**The DM (primary).** The result block names the weakest pillar in its heading
("Stuck on money?") and shows the message already written in a dashed preview:

> Mark — just ran a deal through Deal Check. Scored 47, on life support.
> Weakest pillar is money: who exactly has told you the money is available?
> I don't have a good answer yet. Worth 20 minutes?

**COPY THIS & DM ME** copies it and opens LinkedIn. A second, hotter version
appears at the end of Boss Mode when the seller fails questions — that is the
peak-discomfort moment and converts better than the calm one. See `dmText()`,
`dmGrillText()`, `copyDM()`.

**The squares (secondary).** Copy/share emit a block that reads in any channel:

```
Deal Check 47 · ON LIFE SUPPORT
● ○ ◐ ● ○
CUSTOMER · MONEY · POWER · PATH · NOW

Your boss is going to come after the money.
killmydeal.com/#ynsyn
```

Filled / half / empty circles rather than coloured squares: emoji colours belong
to whatever platform renders them so they never match the palette, and red vs
green is invisible to a colourblind reader. These inherit the message's own text
colour anywhere they land.

**The link.** A result is five letters — y/s/n in pillar order — in the URL hash.
`killmydeal.com/#ynsyn` restores that verdict, shows a "someone sent you this"
banner, and offers to run the reader's own. No storage, no server: the deal *is*
the five answers, so the five answers *are* the URL.

**The hash is written only when the user asks for it.** Finishing a deal does not
touch the address bar; Copy link does. Hash fragments never reach a server, but
they do land in browser history, and "nothing is saved" is easier to defend when
the tool doesn't quietly write someone's answers into a URL they never chose to
share. Incoming shared hashes still restore normally.

**The three actions are deliberately distinct:** *Copy for review* gives the
formatted block, *Copy link* gives the bare URL, the DM button copies the
message. `copyDM()` calls `window.open` synchronously inside the click — a
deferred open after an await or a timeout gets eaten by popup blockers.

**Every copy path goes through `copyText()`**, which returns the promise so
failures are caught. `writeText` is async: a synchronous `try/catch` around it
misses permission denials and the button then lies about having copied. On
failure the labels say what to do instead ("Copy failed — use the address bar",
"Press and hold the text above to copy"). Verified with clipboard access
denied.

---

## 8. Style guide

### The one thing

The tool must do one thing perfectly: tell a seller, in a minute, whether the
deal is real. Every design decision is measured against that. If an element
doesn't serve it, it is there because it could be, and it goes.

### Two colors, seeded from the bird

**Ink and blue.** Every neutral — surfaces, inks, hairlines — is the bird's
hue (207) at very low chroma, so the page and the mark belong to each other:
`#F9FCFF` surface, `#EDF2F7` cards, `#131619` ink. Blue is the old Twitter
blue, `#1DA1F2`, and it means *go*: it is on exactly one element per screen
(the primary button) plus links and the filled progress segments. The verdict
card is the one place colour means something else: a traffic light in
pastels. Green `#C6EBC9`, yellow `#FFF982`, orange `#FFCF8A`, washed red
`#F5B3AD` for the four tiers, ink text on all of them (`--v-*` tokens; dark
mode dims each a step). The red must read as red, not pink: keep the blue out
of it. Nowhere else on the site uses these colours.

**The verdict word is the hero, and the number is literal.** The 0 to 100
score still runs underneath to pick the tier, but nobody sees it. The card
shows the verdict word (HOPIUM, KILL IT, THE PATCH), then one line: *2½ of 5
proven. Weakest: money.* A yes is one, a sort of is a half. That is a number
someone who has never seen the tool understands at a glance, and it is what
the DM and the share block now carry instead of "scored 56". Pipeline Check
keeps its number because 1.1X is a real quantity.

**Labels are 15 characters or fewer.** `.verdict-word` is sized with `clamp`
to fit two lines at a 360px phone and never breaks mid-word; every label on
every tool has been rendered at 360 and 390 and checked. Hyphenated labels
break at the hyphen and look wrong, which is why *Co-marketing* became *All
talk*. If you add a verdict, keep it short and run `shot/fit.js` or eyeball
it at 360.

**Deal Check's bottom tier is KILL IT**, not *Dead on arrival*. The
medical ladder stays for the middle two; the bottom one is the instruction.

**In the dark, the button is the bird.** Dark-mode primary is `#9DD2FF` with
`#00182B` text, so the logo and the action share a colour. Surfaces are the
same hue near black (`#101418`). It is the same design inverted, not a
second one.

The light blue is 2.8:1 against white, which fails WCAG AA. That was a
deliberate call: the brand colour wins here. Don't "fix" it by darkening.

**Components never contain a literal hex.** They consume `--bg`, `--ink`,
`--accent` and the rest. If you find yourself typing a `#` inside a component
rule, you are adding a colour to the system; add a token and name what it
means.

### Type and spacing

Inter set the way Apple sets SF: tight negative tracking on headlines
(−.025em at 36px), generous line height on body (17px / 1.47), and whitespace
doing the work borders used to. Headline → dek → one button. Section headings
at 28px. Overlines at 12px uppercase +.06em in `--ink-2` label every card.

### Components

Buttons (pill, 44 / 54dp, grey by default, blue for primary, text for
utilities, `scale(.97)` on press); choices (60dp grey pills, all identical);
the segmented five-pill progress; cards (`--bg-2`, 20px radius); lists inside
cards with hairline dividers; text fields (label above, grey fill, blue ring
on focus); the app bar with one chip pointing at the other tool. Nothing else.

### Motion

Every screen change fades up 10px over 420ms (`--ease-out`). The verdict
number and label pop in on a spring; the attack line and subtitle fade after.
Buttons compress on press. That is all the motion there is, and it is enough.

### What was cut, and why

The home screen used to carry a five-question list, a doorway card and five
navigation chips under the button. The list restated the tool, the doorway
duplicated the header chip, and the chips navigated to headings a scroll
finds anyway. The result screen merged "be ready for" and "do this" into one
card, moved the arithmetic into the FAQ, and collapsed three text actions to
*Share* and *Start over*. The three-ways cards became three paragraphs. If
you add something back, ask which of the eight questions it answers.

### The Mark section

It is the mentorship pitch, and it is written to the manager, who is the
buyer. Credentials in two sentences, then *A few things I see a lot*: four
situations carried over from the old consulting site (the pipeline looks
better than it is; the partner likes you but nothing happens; busy team, no
rhythm; the number from above disagrees with the number below), then the
thesis: figure out which problem you have before you fix the wrong one, which
is also what the tools do. The tools are how a mentor introduces himself at
scale; this section is where the mentor shows up. Do not reframe it around
the tool. The free tier is *Talk it through*, 20 minutes, and it accepts a
deal, a pipeline or a rep. The old consulting site is retired; nothing else
from it comes over. Same markup on both pages; edit both.

### Voice

Plain, specific, unsparing. One verb: commit. Never label the tone.

**Case, one rule per kind of thing.** Buttons, chips and links are sentence
case, because they are instructions (*Kill my deal*, *Grill me*, *Start
over*). The two product names are proper nouns in title case wherever they are
named rather than clicked (*Deal Check*, *Pipeline Check*, in the wordmark,
the footer, prose and the pipeline overline). The five pillars are identifiers
and are always capitals (*CUSTOMER*, in the answer list, the share block, the
section headings and the five-word line under the hero); after the colon in a
heading the question starts with a capital, as any sentence does. The four
verdicts are capitals in the verdict card only, as display, and sentence case
in prose and the FAQ. Overlines are sentence case in the source and uppercased
by CSS. Nothing else on the site is in capitals. No stat bar. No faces in chrome. **No em or en dashes anywhere
in site copy**, and go easy on the "not X, it is Y" construction. Both are
machine tells. Use a colon, a comma, parentheses, or a new sentence.

## 9. Where to change things

| Change | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Question wording or options | `const P = [...]` at the top of the script |
| Weights, caps, thresholds | `function score()` |
| Attack lines | `ATTACK`, `POWER_ATTACKS` |
| Boss Mode questions, BE READY FOR | `const GRILL` |
| DO THIS actions | `const FIX` |
| The DM copy | `dmText()`, `dmGrillText()` |
| Share block format | `shareBlock()`, `DIAL` |
| Mark's block after a result | `mountMark()` |
| SEO copy, FAQ, bio, offer | the `<section class="band">` blocks |
| Structured data | the `application/ld+json` block in `<head>` |
| Google Analytics ID, events | `analytics.js` |
| Colour, type, shape, motion | `:root` tokens at the top of `site.css` |
| Pipeline Check model, tiers, copy | `compute()` in `pipeline/index.html` |
| Pipeline Check share / DM | `shareBlock()`, `dmText()` there — the DM carries multiples, never dollars |

## 10. SEO and social

- One `<h1>`, rendered as **static HTML**, not by JavaScript. The script captures
  it into `INTRO_HTML` at load and restores it on return home, so crawlers and
  no-JS visitors get real content and there is never a second `<h1>`.
- Canonical URL, description, OpenGraph and Twitter tags, `card.jpg` at 1200×630
  with width, height and alt declared.
- The `<title>` carries the search terms ("Federal Sales Pipeline Review Tool |
  Deal Check"); the bluebird line stays the `<h1>` and the OpenGraph title,
  where it actually does its work.
- JSON-LD: `WebApplication`, `Person`, `FAQPage`. Treat it as semantic
  housekeeping rather than an SEO lever — Google no longer shows standalone FAQ
  rich results in normal search, and `HowTo` was dropped because Google retired
  it in 2023 and it was the five pillars stated a fourth time. **The JSON-LD FAQ
  text must match the on-page FAQ word for word**; it drifted once and carried a
  privacy claim the page had already retired.
- ~1,300 words across five sections: the five questions and what each disproves,
  why not BANT/MEDDIC, the pipeline review (sellers first, then managers), the
  bio, and the FAQ. Each pillar is explained **once**. An earlier build explained
  them three times — as signals, as bullets, and as failure-pattern cards — and
  the repetition read as filler. Written for sellers, not for a keyword. Thin SEO
  filler would undercut the only thing the tool is selling, which is credibility.
- The dek names the audience: *Built for federal sellers.* Everything above the
  fold was otherwise generic sales-speak, and federal is the reason PATH exists.

To regenerate the cards: `python3 make-card.py deal` and `python3 make-card.py
pipeline` from the web root (they use `inter.woff2` and `bluebird.png`, so the
cards cannot drift from the pages' typeface or palette). Change the copy in the
script's `CARDS` table, not the JPEG. A card must carry its page's current hero
and dek; it fell out of sync once.

---

## 11. Traps that have already bitten

- **Leftover grid columns.** `.markblk` kept `grid-template-columns:64px 1fr`
  after its avatar was removed, squeezing the DM preview into a 64px lane, one
  word per line. It is `display:block` now.
- **Class-name collisions.** `.mark` was the pillar checkmark style before the
  bio block reused it and got forced to 40px wide. The bio block is `.markblk`.
- **Logo with a white background.** The first bird PNG was not transparent and
  showed as a white box on the tinted surface. The shipped `bluebird.png` has
  the field knocked out and is trimmed to the art.
- **Long button labels.** Two CTAs have overflowed on a phone. Buttons are
  `white-space:nowrap` with ellipsis; short labels are the real fix.
- **Duplicate script tags.** Assembling this page from the tool-only version
  once included the script twice and every `const` collided. There should be
  exactly two `<script>` elements: JSON-LD and the app.
- **Share text duplicating the URL.** `shareBlock()` already ends with the link.
- **Regex that eats the rest of a tag.** A `<link rel="icon">` replacement
  stopped at the first `>` inside a data URI and left `😵">` visible on the page.
- **Opening a tab before copying.** `window.open` moves focus; Chrome then
  rejects `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with "document is not focused", so
  the DM copied nothing and the catch stuffed a sentence into a 44px pill.
  Copy now runs synchronously inside the click through a hidden textarea and
  LinkedIn opens after it succeeds. Button feedback is two words, always.
- **Passing a handler the event.** `back2.onclick = result` handed the click
  event to `result(shared)`, so *Back to the verdict* showed "Someone sent you
  this verdict" on the user's own deal. Wrap it: `() => result(false)`.
- **Focus ring changing the shape.** `:focus-visible { border-radius:8px }`
  reset every pill button to 8px corners on keyboard focus. The ring is
  `outline` only now, in `--primary-ink` so it clears AA on the light surface.
- **Favicon inlined as base64.** A 256px PNG as a data URI put 69 KB in `<head>`,
  more than the font. It is `favicon.png` (64px) and `apple-touch-icon.png` now.
- **`theme-color` from a template.** It was M3's default lavender `#FEF7FF`,
  not the surface. Light and dark values are declared with media queries.

---

## 12. Deploy (AWS Amplify Hosting, from GitHub)

The repo is the site. `amplify.yml` has no build step; its build phase only
deletes files that belong in the repo but not on the web (`preview/`,
`HANDOFF.md`, `make-card.py`). `customHttp.yml` sets security headers and
caching: HTML is `no-cache`, CSS and JS one hour, the font a year, images a
week. There is no asset versioning, so a CSS change is live within an hour.

Set these in the Amplify console; they cannot live in the repo.

1. **Domain.** Attach **sellclouds.com** under *Hosting → Custom domains*,
   with www redirecting to the apex. killmydeal.com was retired at launch
   and is not used anywhere.
2. **Rewrites and redirects** (*Hosting → Rewrites and redirects → Manage
   redirects → text editor*), in this order; the 404 catch-all must be last:

```json
[
  { "source": "https://www.sellclouds.com/<*>", "status": "301", "target": "https://sellclouds.com/<*>" },
  { "source": "/deal", "status": "301", "target": "/deal/" },
  { "source": "/pipeline", "status": "301", "target": "/pipeline/" },
  { "source": "/brief", "status": "301", "target": "/brief/" },
  { "source": "/territory", "status": "301", "target": "/territory/" },
  { "source": "/partner", "status": "301", "target": "/partner/" },
  { "source": "/rep", "status": "301", "target": "/rep/" },
  { "source": "/olr", "status": "301", "target": "/olr/" },
  { "source": "/notes", "status": "301", "target": "/notes/" },
  { "source": "/<*>", "status": "404", "target": "/404.html" }
]
```

3. **Search Console.** Verify sellclouds.com and submit its sitemap.
4. **Analytics**: paste the GA4 measurement ID into `GA_ID` in `analytics.js`.
5. **Calendly**: the free call is described as 20 minutes everywhere; make
   sure the `chat-with-mark` event is 20 minutes, or change the copy.

After deploy: open the site, type `SC_BUILD` in the console and check it
matches this file; share a link in Slack or LinkedIn and confirm `card.jpg`
renders; submit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console.

**`mark.jpg` still needs replacing.** The current headshot has background
artifacts. A clean 640×640 on a plain background.

## 13. Testing before you ship

1. Answer all five questions; the verdict block appears in the right colour.
2. GRILL ME asks three questions and reaches a closing verdict; failing any
   shows the DM block underneath.
3. COPY THIS & DM ME copies the written message and opens LinkedIn.
4. *Copy for review* emits the circles block, *Copy link* emits only the URL,
   and the address bar stays clean until one of them is pressed.
5. Opening that link in a fresh tab restores the verdict with the "someone sent
   you this" banner.
6. The logo returns home with answers cleared and exactly one `<h1>`.
7. DevTools → Network shows only the page's own files (`index.html`, the
   images, `favicon.png`) and nothing to any other host.
8. At 390px nothing overflows horizontally and no button clips its label.
9. Dark mode: the button is bird-blue with navy text; links stay legible.
10. No combination of answers containing a NO returns HEALTHY.
11. GRILL ME → *Back to the verdict* does **not** show the "someone sent you
    this" banner.
12. Tab through the answer buttons: they stay pills while focused.

## 15. Pipeline Check

The manager's half. Inputs: revenue target, qualified pipeline due in the
period, qualified win rate; behind *Go deeper*: average deal size, sellers,
closed so far, months in / months left. Sales-cycle days were cut — nine
fields is not a one-minute tool.

**It is a calculator, not a question set, and must stay one.** Managers and
sellers want to change a field and watch the gap move. A two-step stepper was
tried in September 2026 and reverted: it made the one numeric tool behave
like the question tools and hid the numbers people came for. Every field is
visible (target, pipeline, win rate with Federal / SaaS / A third chips, deal
size, sellers, closed so far, a Dec 31 / Sep 30 year-end chip, *Just me*),
prefilled with an example, and everything updates on input. Money fields
tidy themselves on blur ("10m" becomes "$10M"); focusing a field selects it
so typing over the example is one step.

**The light bulb is the example and the bar.** The page opens on $10M
target, $32M pipeline, 25% win rate: 3.2X, which 3X calls covered and the win
rate calls *Hopium, $8M short*. The verdict's attack line is that sentence
(`flip` in `compute()`), and under the verdict a coverage bar puts your
pipeline, the 3X line and your own line on one scale, with the gap shaded in
the verdict colour. Seeing your line sit past the 3X line is the insight; do
not replace the example with one where the two agree.

**Layout.** Phone: fields, then verdict. While the fields are on screen and
the verdict is below the fold, a summary strip rides at the bottom (*3.2X
hopium · $8M short at 25%*) so the answer is visible while typing; it hides
once the verdict is in view or scrolled past. Desktop (≥ 880px): fields
left, verdict sticky right, no strip. The page widens via `.wrap.wide`.

**Rows.** You have; 3X says you need (and short or covered); your win rate
says (and short or covered); the gap with deal count; per seller (or *For
you* when sellers is 1) with deals each. The clock line fills itself from the
date and year-end chip, with pace when closed-so-far is known.

**Lead with the win rate, show 3X as the thing being killed.** Required pipeline
is `still-to-find ÷ win rate` (× 3 if no win rate given). 3X is a 33% win rate
in disguise; the page says so. The old consulting site had this backwards —
3X was the benchmark and win rate was "go deeper" — and in this voice that
makes the name a costume.

Verdict is `pipeline ÷ required`, on the same ladder as Deal Check:
COVERED ≥ 1.0 · HOPIUM ≥ .75 · ON LIFE SUPPORT ≥ .5 · DEAD ON ARRIVAL below.
The tier that justifies the product is HOPIUM at ≥ 3X: *"3X says you're fine.
Your win rate says you need 3.3X."* DEAD ON ARRIVAL at the start of a period
is a creation problem, not a closing problem, and the copy says that; the
"period is already written" line lives in the pace block, which only appears
when closed-so-far and months are given.

**The hand-off runs both ways.** Every pipeline verdict ends with *how much of
the pipeline you already have would survive Deal Check?* and a KILL A DEAL
button. The homepage's review section carries the doorway the other way
(*Managing the whole pipeline?* → PIPELINE CHECK). Neither tool's result
screen links to the other above the DM; the DM stays the conversion path.

**Dollars.** This tool necessarily asks for them, which Deal Check never does.
So: the DM contains multiples only (*I'm at 1.1X; my win rate says I need
3.3X*). *Copy for review* does contain dollars because the person chose to
copy it. Copy link writes the inputs to the hash only when pressed, same rule
as the other page.

**Not brought over from the old consulting site:** the gtag/plausible hooks,
the stat bar, the rep-archetype section (content topics, not homepage), the
partner-strategy material, the generic GTM positioning. The federal specialty
pitch is already the dek. The old site should be retired; this is the front
door now.

## 16. Rep, Partner, Territory, and the engine

The three newer tools share one script, `check.js`. Each page is a shell
plus a config passed to `CheckTool({...})`: five questions, weights, a
`verdict(answers, total, weak)` function, the question the boss will ask per
pillar (`grill`), the first move per pillar (`moves`), a hand-off card, the
Mark card copy and the DM template. The engine does the rest: intro, the
five screens with segmented progress, the result, share (five-letter hash,
same as Deal Check), the DM, analytics events named `<slug>_start`,
`<slug>_verdict`, `<slug>_share`, `<slug>_dm_copy`.

**The pages are generated.** Edit copy in `make-tools.py`, run it from the web
root, commit the three `index.html` files it writes. Do not hand-edit those
files; the next run overwrites them. The generator also builds the header
menu from its `TOOLS` list, and copies the Mark section out of `index.html`,
so the bio is edited once.

**Deal Check and Pipeline Check keep their own scripts.** Deal has Boss
Mode and the score caps; Pipeline is arithmetic, not questions. Porting Deal
onto the engine is possible and was not worth the regression risk.

**Two verdict shapes.** Partner and Territory score 0 to 100 on the Deal
ladder (green ≥ 75, yellow ≥ 55, orange ≥ 35, red below) with a NO capping the
score at 74; the card shows the word and the literal count, never the score.
**Rep is a diagnosis, not a score**: `capOnNo: false`, `count: false`, and
`verdict()` returns one of six labels by rule.

**Rep Check asks about the situation before the person.** The five, in
order: PATCH (could a good rep make this number here, on this plan), CUSTOMERS
(do customers choose them; pull, not meeting count), PIPELINE (what exists
because they're here), CRAFT (can they actually sell), WILL (are they still
trying). CRAFT is the question that separates *can't* from *isn't*, which are
different management problems, and it was missing from the first version.
The verdicts are the four managerial buckets plus two: *The situation* (patch
no; good rep, bad situation), *Coach them* (craft no, will yes), *Manage them*
(craft yes, effort or activity no), *Wrong rep* (craft no and will no), *They're
fine* (all yes; leave them alone) and *Not sure*. Order of evaluation matters:
the situation is checked before anything about the person, so a rep in a dead
patch is never called a performance problem. The hand-off depends on the
verdict (`handoff` may be a function): *The situation* sends them to Kill My
Territory; everything else says sit with the rep and run five real deals
through Deal Check, which is the best advice on the page. Comp is part of
PATCH ("on this plan"); do not add it back as a sixth question. Five is the
family.

**Hand-offs follow the verdict, and they form a loop.** Deal is the front
door and has no outbound hand-off; the other four all point somewhere that
makes sense for the verdict they just gave: Pipeline → Deal ("how much of
this survives?"), or → Territory when the gap is a creation problem (ratio
under .5); Partner → Deal for *Real* and *All talk*, → Pipeline ("how much of
your number is leaning on them?") for *Neighbors* and *Logo swap*; Territory →
Pipeline for *Workable* and *Thin*, → Rep ("their version of this question,
and its first question is the patch") for *A stretch* and *Nobody could*;
Rep → Territory for *The situation*, → Deal ("sit with them and run five real
deals") for everything else. Every page also listens for `hashchange`, so a
shared link opened in an already-open tab renders.

**The booking link arrives already knowing the verdict.** Every *Or book 20
minutes* link on every result screen carries Calendly's `a1=` parameter,
which prefills the first question on the event type (the default "anything
to help prepare" question counts). The note is the verdict, the count and
the weakest pillar, or for Pipeline the coverage multiples and pace: *Kill My
Pipeline: 1.9X coverage, dead on arrival, needs 5.0X at 20%, 4.1x current
pace.* Never a name, never a dollar figure; the old site's version sent
dollars and this one must not. If the Calendly event type's first question
is ever removed, the prefill silently does nothing, which is fine.

**OLR Check grades the case, never the rep.** It was built as *Kill My
Case* at `/case/` and renamed because most users are at Amazon and OLR is the
word they use; *case* stays in body copy where it is the precise word (the
room tests your case), but not in the name, URL, card, menu or DMs. The FAQ
defines OLR for anyone who isn't Amazon, and says the tool works the same in
any calibration room. `/case/` 301s to `/olr/` (Amplify console rule). Built for the AWS talent
review (evaluate, calibrate, communicate) but true of any calibration room:
the manager proposes, the room probes, and all the room can test is the case.
Five questions about the case: RECEIPTS (three things with numbers, the
Forte framing), OWNERSHIP (what wouldn't have happened without them), SCOPE
(their level, not strong execution a level down), HOW (an example per
principle cited), NEXT (the harder thing you'd hand them). Verdicts are
brief-quality only: *Ready*, *Thin*, *A story*, *No receipts*. It never asks
a name, never predicts, suggests or mentions a rating, and the FAQ says so.
The engine's **Grill mode** was added for it (`grillSet`: three questions per
pillar, `fix`, `grillLines`, `dmGrill`); it works the same as Deal Check's
Boss Mode and is available to any tool that provides a `grillSet`. The bias
checklist (recency, visibility, halo, horns, style, context) is a band, not a
screen: it is the thing to read, not a form to fill. The research that led
here proposed evidence-entry screens, a team table and local storage; all of
that is typing, and the tools don't ask for typing.

**Brief Check is the first tool whose audience is wider than sales**, and
its copy is written for someone presenting a six-pager to a VP as much as
for a QBR. The premise, from the research that led to it: the room is not
attacking the document, it is attacking the assumptions underneath it. Five
questions about the argument: POINT (one sentence, and why now), RECEIPTS
(evidence for the three load-bearing claims, at least one from outside your
team), ALTERNATIVE (including doing nothing), HOLE (your own weakest
assumption and who will find it), ASK (what you need today and who owns
what). Verdicts: *Room ready*, *A fight*, *Shark food*, *No point*. The hero
is the signature question, *What's the question you're hoping nobody asks?*
The research proposed eight questions; the three extra (why, so what,
audience) live inside POINT, RECEIPTS and HOLE.

**The sharks.** Grill mode on this tool opens with *Who's across the table?*
and five choices (Finance, the executive, the technical leader, the sales
leader, the skeptic); each shark has three questions for every pillar, so the
grill is always that chair's questions about your weakest answer. This is the
engine's `sharks` option (`{ id: { name, qs: { pillar: [3] } } }` plus
`sharkPrompt`); a tool without `sharks` grills from `grillSet` as before. The
chooser lives after the verdict, never on the intro: personalization comes
after value. Nothing is ever uploaded; the tool never sees a word of the
document.

**Names.** None of the five ever asks for one, and the DM templates carry the
verdict and the weakest pillar only. A tool that stores judgments about named
people is a different product.

**The bird always goes home.** Every page's header is the same: bird plus
*Deal Check*, linking to `/`. The tool's own name is the small label above
its headline (`.tool-name`). An earlier version put the tool name in the
header and made it restart the tool, which meant tapping the logo never
reached the front door. Restarting a tool is *Start over* and the back
gesture; the logo is navigation. On the home page itself the logo returns to
the intro.

**Header and the kit's frame.** The *Tools* menu is a `<details>` with no JS,
grouped by audience: *For sellers* (Deal, Territory), *For managers*
(Pipeline, Rep, Partner, Case), *For anyone* (Brief), each with the moment
it's for under the name. The home page carries *Seven places hope gets in*
directly under the tool, before the essay: one line per tool, organized by
**moment, not funnel stage** (before commit, month one in a patch, before a
meeting, Monday with a worrying rep, quarterly, review season). That is the
kit's honest shape, seven inspection points rather than prospecting-to-close,
and it is the Rick Steves frame: which line to skip, where the back door is.
The `TOOLS` list in `make-tools.py` is the single source for the menu; add a
tool there with its group and its moment. That list and the menu are the only
cross-navigation; do not add a tools portal page.

**Shared behaviors, in all three runtimes** (the flagship's inline script,
the pipeline page's, and `check.js`), kept identical on purpose:
- *History.* Every screen is a history entry (`nav()`), so the phone's back
  gesture steps back one screen, including back through Grill to the shark
  chooser, instead of leaving the site. In-page *← Back* buttons call
  `history.back()` so the two stacks never disagree. Re-renders of the same
  screen (a win-rate chip) replace rather than push.
- *Focus.* Every screen change moves focus to the new question, verdict or
  heading (`focusScreen()`), with no visible ring for programmatic focus.
- *Share.* On a touch device *Share* opens the native share sheet with the
  verdict as text and the link as URL; elsewhere, or if the sheet fails, it
  copies. Cancelling the sheet does nothing.
- *Menu.* The Tools menu closes on an outside tap and on Escape.
- *Shared links.* Every page, the flagship included, renders a shared link
  opened in a tab that already has the site (`hashchange`).

**Structured data follows the page.** The last step of `make-tools.py`
rebuilds every page's FAQPage JSON-LD from its visible FAQ, including the
two hand-written pages. Edit the visible FAQ, run the script, done. It drifted
three times by hand; it cannot now.

**The header bird is `bird-sm.png`** (90px, 2 KB, and `bird-sm-dark.png`).
`bluebird.png` is only for the 404 and the share cards.

**One vocabulary.** Pipeline's bottom tier is *Kill it*, same as Deal. No two
tools share a verdict word (OLR's middle tier is *Not yet*, Territory keeps
*Thin*). Nobody outside the source says "pillar"; copy says "answer".

## 17. Changelog

**2026-09-18.1400** — review pass.
- `card.jpg` regenerated to match the current hero and dek (it still carried
  the retired bluebird line); `make-card.py` added so it cannot drift again.
- Content: the five pillars explained once instead of three times; the review
  section and the managers section merged; FAQ entries that restated sections
  above cut; the bluebird FAQ entry added; the third consulting tier reshaped
  for teams; "Built for federal sellers" added to the dek.
- Bugs: *Back to the verdict* showing the shared-link banner; focus ring
  reshaping buttons; `theme-color` mismatch; stale privacy claim in JSON-LD;
  shared hash surviving *Kill another deal* from the Boss Mode screen.
- Housekeeping: dead CSS and JS state removed (`mode`, `nick`, `step`,
  `setHome`, `MARK`, `strongOnes`, input/ghost/avatar rules); `HowTo` schema
  dropped; favicon moved out of the head; `color-scheme` and dark
  `theme-color` declared; answer buttons are plain buttons in a `group` rather
  than radios that never get checked. Page 192 KB → 118 KB.

**2026-09-18.1500** — cohesion pass.
- One button component with three emphasis levels replaces `.big`, `.act`,
  `.act-p`, `.cta-a`, `.cta-b`, `.linkbtn`, `.back`; shape morphing now applies
  to every button including the primary. Label case made consistent.
- Shape tokens replace nine ad-hoc radii; signals list uses the same grouped
  idiom as the answer set.
- Header aligned with the prose column; *Work with Mark* text link added.
- Boss Mode close: navigation buttons outlined so the DM is the only filled one.
- `h1` weight 400 → 700 to match the card, the question type and the verdicts.

**2026-09-18.1700** — Pipeline Check.
- `/pipeline/` added: coverage against target and win rate, same ladder, same
  share/DM pattern, cross-linked both ways. `card-pipeline.jpg` and a
  `pipeline` mode in `make-card.py`.
- Shared `site.css` and `inter.woff2` extracted; `index.html` 118 KB → 37 KB.
- Homepage: doorway block in the review section, footer link, `knowsAbout`
  on the Person schema (the one useful thing in the old site's structured data).
- `sitemap.xml` lists both pages.

**2026-09-18.1900** — UX pass.
- Header: single assist chip that swaps between the two tools; *Work with Mark*
  header link removed. Doorway moved onto the home screen under the peek.
- `/pipeline/` opens on example numbers with a live verdict and an EXAMPLE chip;
  bio section added; KILL A DEAL is tonal under the filled DM.
- Buttons no longer shape-morph or scale on press; state layer only.
- Bio text wraps the photo instead of a second column.
- `bluebird-dark.png`: light outline for dark mode, via `<picture>`.
- Privacy copy cut to dek + FAQ per page; footer is one line; build stamp
  removed from the footer (still in `window.SC_BUILD`).

**2026-09-18.2100** — Material Design 3 rebuild.
- `site.css` rewritten from tokens up: full M3 color roles (light primary is now
  tone 40 with white text; the bird blue is primary-container / dark primary),
  the M3 shape scale, the M3 type scale, standard easings.
- Every element is now an M3 component: app bar + assist chip, buttons in
  four emphases and two sizes, list items, cards, filled text fields, linear
  progress, expansion. The answer "bun" is gone: three size-M tonal buttons.
- Button labels in sentence case throughout.
- Dark-mode bird outline is pure white.
- Pipeline page: bio photo path fixed, go-deeper labels shortened to fit the
  two-column grid.
- `preview/` folder in the package: headless-Chromium screenshots of every
  screen in both schemes, taken from this build.

**2026-09-19.0900** — palette.
- Primary a step lighter (`#0B5A9A` → `#0F73BC`), toward Twitter blue, at the
  lightest value that still passes AA with white text. Pastel Twitter blue in
  `primary-container`.
- Dark mode rebuilt as muted charcoal neutrals with pastel containers; all
  pairs ≥ 7:1.
- Neutrals quieter on both sides (lighter dividers, softer secondary text).
- Cards regenerated in the new palette; `theme-color` updated.

**2026-09-19.1200** — one thing.
- Monochrome: ink plus Twitter blue. All semantic colours removed; verdict is
  ink, HEALTHY / COVERED is blue.
- Home screen reduced to headline, dek, button, the five words. Result screen
  reduced to verdict, answers, one next-step card, Grill me, Share / Start over.
- Segmented progress restored. Screen transitions, verdict spring, press
  compression added.
- Apple-style type scale and spacing. Three-ways cards → paragraphs. Score
  arithmetic → FAQ. Field labels above inputs.

**2026-09-19.1400** — seeded neutrals.
- Neutrals re-derived from the bird's hue on both sides; dark-mode primary is
  the bird itself (`#9DD2FF`); highlight container from the same ramp.
  Semantic colours and the dark primary button were considered and declined
  (see §8).

**2026-09-19.1600** — copy and clutter.
- Copy fixed: synchronous `execCommand` copy inside the click, iOS range
  selection, LinkedIn opened after success; feedback is "Copied ✓" or
  "Couldn't copy" and nothing longer. Tapping a DM preview selects it.
- Boss Mode close screen: one Mark card (with the Boss Mode DM text) instead
  of an inline DM block plus a second Mark card; one text link back to the
  verdict instead of two buttons.
- Mark card: primary button full width, Calendly as a text link below.

**2026-09-19.1700** — hero line: *Before you commit it, try to kill it.* Updated in the h1, og/twitter titles and alts, and `card.jpg`.

**2026-09-20.0900** — launch prep.
- `analytics.js` (GA4, hash stripped, parameter-free events, early-event
  queue) on both pages; FAQ and JSON-LD privacy wording updated to match.
- Pipeline dek rewritten. Bio: "Marine" for "Marine officer".
- All em and en dashes removed from site copy; two "not X, it is Y" lines
  tightened.
- `amplify.yml`, `customHttp.yml`, `404.html` added; §12 rewritten for Amplify.

**2026-09-20.1100** — case audit: pillar headings capitalise after the colon; FAQ referenced the old *GRILL ME* label; case rules written into §8.

**2026-09-20.1300** — verdict pastels (green / yellow / peach / pink) in light and dark, from user feedback; blue back to meaning the button only.

**2026-09-21.0900** — Mark section rewritten on both pages as the mentorship pitch: credentials, four situations, the thesis, three ways to work together; free tier is *Talk it through*, 20 minutes; CTA *Talk with Mark*.

**2026-09-21.1300** — Rep Check, Partner Check, Territory Check.
- `check.js` shared engine; `make-tools.py` generates the three pages from one
  template and the copy in the script.
- Header *Tools* menu on every page; *Other things worth killing* list on the
  home page; sitemap and share cards for all five tools.
- Rep is a rule-based diagnosis with six verdicts; Partner and Territory
  score on the Deal ladder.

**2026-09-22.0900** — verdict card rework.
- Traffic-light pastels: orange and washed red replace peach and pink.
- Verdict word is the hero on every question tool; the literal count (*2½ of
  5 proven*) and the weakest pillar replace the 0 to 100 score on the card,
  in the DM and in the share block.
- *Dead on arrival* is now *Kill it* on Deal Check. Rep verdicts shortened
  to fit (*They're fine*, *The patch*, *The plan*, *Checked out*, *The rep*,
  *Not sure*); Partner verdicts renamed *Real*, *All talk*, *Neighbors*, *Logo
  swap*. All labels fit-tested at 360 and 390px.

**2026-09-24.0900** — Rep Check rebuilt on the situation-first five (PATCH,
CUSTOMERS, PIPELINE, CRAFT, WILL) with the four-bucket verdicts; hand-off now
follows the verdict; engine supports `handoff` as a function. Card and home
list updated.

**2026-09-24.1100** — hand-offs on Pipeline, Partner and Territory now depend on the verdict (see §16); pipeline page handles `hashchange`.

**2026-09-25.0900** — Pipeline Check restructured: two-step entry, verdict
at 3X, win-rate chips that flip the verdict in place with the flip recorded
on the card, calendar-filled months with a Dec 31 / Sep 30 chip and a clock
line, three result rows with the arithmetic behind a button, "Just me".

**2026-09-25.1100** — Calendly `a1=` prefill on every tool, multiples and verdict words only.

**2026-09-26.0900** — Kill My Case at `/case/`: five questions on the
manager's case for a rep, verdicts on the case only, Grill mode ("the room"
asks three), bias-check band. Grill mode added to `check.js`. Menu, home list,
footer, sitemap, share card updated.

**2026-09-26.1200** — Brief Check at `/brief/`: five questions on the
argument, four verdicts, Grill mode with a shark chooser (five chairs, three
questions each per pillar). Engine gained `sharks`. Menu, home list, footer,
sitemap, share card updated.

**2026-09-27.0900** — kit review: Tools menu grouped by audience with the
moment under each name; home page list rewritten by moment and moved under
the tool; Pipeline bottom tier *Kill it*; Case middle tier *Not yet*; bio
free tier accepts "a territory you've been handed".

**2026-09-28.0900** — audit fixes: back gesture steps through screens on
every tool; focus moves to each new screen; native share sheet on phones;
Tools menu closes on outside tap and Escape; the flagship handles shared
links in an open tab; `--ink-3` darkened to pass AA in both schemes (4.7:1
light, 6.2:1 dark); FAQ JSON-LD generated from the visible FAQ on every
build; header bird 56 KB → 2 KB.

**2026-09-29.0900** — Kill My Case renamed **OLR Check** at `/olr/`: name, title, hero, CTA, DMs, card (`card-olr.jpg`), menu, home list, footer, sitemap; FAQ adds *What is OLR?*; `/case/` redirects.

**2026-09-30.0900** — Pipeline Check back to a live calculator: every field
visible and prefilled, updates on input, coverage bar with the 3X line and
your win-rate line, the flip sentence as the verdict line, a summary strip on
phones, two columns on desktop. The stepper from 2026-09-25 is gone.

**2026-09-30.1100** — logo links home on every page with one wordmark, *Deal Check*; each tool's name moved to a label above its headline.

**2026-10-01.0900** — **SellClouds.** New home page at `/` (doorways, how the
tools work, Field Notes, About, FAQ); Deal Check moved to `/deal/`; three
Field Notes at `/notes/`; one header and one About section generated onto
every page (SellClouds wordmark, Field Notes, About, Ask Mark, Tools menu);
three-tier offer replaced by *Need another set of eyes?*; every URL, card,
sitemap and structured-data reference moved to sellclouds.com; killmydeal.com
redirects path by path. Field Kits deliberately not built.

**2026-10-01.1100** — original cloud mark for SellClouds in the header, favicon, home-screen icon and home share card; the bird remains the Deal Check mascot on tool cards and the 404.

**2026-10-01.1300** — Mark's S-cloud mark traced to SVG and installed: header (light/dark), SVG favicon that follows the colour scheme, PNG fallbacks, home share card. The interim cloud marks are removed.

**2026-10-01.1500** — logo rebuilt from true geometry (six circles and one curve) in place of the trace; PNGs re-rendered from it.

**2026-10-02.0900** — **Checks.** Kill My X renamed X Check across every
page, card, button, DM, share text and the structured data, under *Quick
reality checks for complicated deals*; headlines reworded (*prove it*, *test
it*); verdicts *At risk*, *Not a deal yet*, *Short*; the bluebird mascot and
its FAQ removed, the logo on every card and the 404 (*Wrong turn.*); `kill.js`
renamed `check.js`. Logo stroke 59 → 70 and header mark 30 → 34px.

**2026-10-02.1100** — launch prep. Every reference to killmydeal.com and
the old name removed from the site, including the home FAQ entry; internal
names renamed (`kmd.css` → `site.css`, `KMD_BUILD` → `SC_BUILD`, the
analytics helper `kmd()` → `track()`, the history key). Titles cut to 60
characters or fewer and descriptions to 160 or fewer so search results
don't truncate them. Font preloaded on every page; SVGs cached. A verdict
restored by the back gesture no longer counts as a second analytics event.
